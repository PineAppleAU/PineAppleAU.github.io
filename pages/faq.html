                <div class="faq">
                    <h3>What should I do if my Vision won't turn on?</h3>
                    <p>Firstly, ensure your Vision is fully charged. If they still won't turn on, perform a hard reset by holding down the power button (the center button located on the front of the frame) for 10 seconds. If issues persist, contact our support team for assistance.</p>

                    <h3>How can I improve tracking accuracy in my living space?</h3>
                    <p>For optimal tracking, ensure your environment is well-lit and has distinct visual features that the glasses can detect. Avoid plain walls and empty spaces. If necessary, recalibrate the tracking through the settings menu.</p>

                <div class="faq">
                    <h3>My Vision is overheating, what can I do?</h3>
                    <p>Unlike computers and other high power devices, the Vision utilises passive cooling to draw heat away from the CPU, however this isnt as efficient as active cooling methods. As such, overheating can result if operated in hot climates or for long periods of time. If your glasses are overheating, take a break from using them to allow them to cool down. Avoid direct sunlight and high-temperature environments. If overheating occurs frequently, contact our customer service.</p>
